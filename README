This is the old calendar application, bundled in early versions of XWiki Enterprise.
It has been removed since it wasn't actively maintained and didn't meet the quality standards required for platform code.

This extension uses the plugin technology which has been deprecated and is now replaced by Components.
If someone is interested in improving this extension, we recommend rewriting it as components.
